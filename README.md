# Black Jack

**Black Jack** is a full-stack blackjack platform that pairs a **Vite-powered React SPA** with an **Express + TypeScript API** to deliver AI-guided gameplay, resilient guest sessions, and multi-channel authentication for casual and registered players.

## Architecture

### **Client (`client/`)**

A **React Router SPA** with dedicated routes for onboarding, play, history, and authentication, plus a **Three.js-powered gold coin hero** element that reinforces the brand.

### **Server (`server/`)**

An **Express API** that orchestrates blackjack rounds, enforces authentication, proxies Gemini hints, and persists history to **PostgreSQL** via a typed data layer and mailer utilities.

### **Shared Persistence**

Authenticated history is written to **PostgreSQL tables**, while **guest mode** relies on **local storage** to remember bankrolls, active games, and offline results for a seamless return experience.

## 🎮 Core Features

-   **Deterministic blackjack engine** – In-memory deck management, scoring, reshuffles, and chip settlement encapsulated in TypeScript for predictable results across rounds.
-   **Guest and authenticated continuity** – Local storage scaffolding ensures guests resume bankrolls and tables, while authenticated sessions persist via tokens and server history records.
-   **Gemini-powered coaching** – A dedicated `/api/games/:id/ai` endpoint requests hit/stand guidance, surfaced contextually in the bottom action bar with visual cues.
-   **Multi-channel authentication** – Password, email code, and Google OAuth logins share JWT issuance and verification, with UI flows for modal or page-based entry.
-   **History tracking** – Completed rounds capture bets, hands, counts, and outcomes for paginated review, supporting both server-backed and offline guest histories.

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

Set these variables before booting the server:

-   **DATABASE_URL** – PostgreSQL connection string; SSL is enabled for hosted deployments.
-   **JWT_SECRET** – Symmetric key for signing and verifying session tokens.
-   **GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID** – OAuth client used to validate Google ID tokens and link accounts.
-   **GOOGLE_API_KEY / GEMINI_API_KEY** – Gemini credentials for AI recommendations (either name is accepted).
-   **CORS_ORIGIN** – Comma-separated allowlist for browser origins interacting with the API.
-   **RESEND_API_KEY, MAIL_FROM** – Required to send verification emails; optional `MAIL_DRY_RUN` and `APP_NAME` adjust delivery behavior.
-   **PORT** – Overrides the Express listen port (defaults to `5174`).

Client-side configuration lives in `client/.env`:

-   **VITE_API_BASE** – Base URL for all API requests.
-   **VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID** – Enables Google One Tap login in the UI.

## 🗄️ Database

Apply the base schema, then optional migrations, to provision **users**, **email codes**, and **history** tables with supporting indexes and **Google OAuth metadata**.
